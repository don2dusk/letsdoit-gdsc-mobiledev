## Getting Started
To be able to download a local copy and store on your device, I advise you make a fork of the repository instead of directly cloning the repository in order to easily account for new commits on this repository.

### Forking the repo
- Click on the fork icon at the top right hand area of this repository.
- Clone the forked repository to your local device
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/letsdoit-gdsc_mobiledev.git
```
- Open the folder in your desired IDE/Code Editor and make your changes

When you are done, you can make a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) and your changes can be merged with the main branch.
